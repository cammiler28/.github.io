        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m a college sophmore majoring in Media Production with a minor in Management. I have a deep passion for producing and editing content, and I thrive in roles where I can lead and collaborate with others. My skills include proficiency in Adobe Premiere Suite, Microsoft Office Suite, web development, and effective communication, all of which are crucial in the media production field. Additionally, I have strong creative and organizational abilities, which help me bring ideas to life while managing projects effectively. I grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia, but have also spent time in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Syracuse, New York. I started my college journey at Central Virginia Community College, where I also earned an Information Technology certificate during my senior year of high school. My goal is to reach a level of creative expression through production while developing my ability to lead and direct teams, ultimately bringing impactful and high-quality content to life!</p>
